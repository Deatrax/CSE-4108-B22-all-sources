# CSE-4108-B22-all-sources
The codes of all the Labs of CSE 4108 of Batch 22 of IUT-CSE, course instructed by Dr. Md Moniruzzaman.


Welcome to the collection of CSE 4108 lab session codes! ðŸŽ‰

I've shared the codes here to help you understand the core concepts and techniques we covered in class. However, please try to code it yourself first before looking at these solutions.
For an extra challenge, Iâ€™ve * **left out the last few labs** *â€”those are for you to figure out yourself! ðŸ˜‰
Hands-on practice is key to mastering these skills, and you'll get more out of the labs by working through them on your own.
I highly suggest that you take a look at the codes and try to understand them first about what is going on. 

Also keep in mind that the codes WILL VERY based on the current instructor and the assigned lab tasks. It is highly discouraged that you copy paste the codes and present them to the course instructor as your finished task as it may bring about grave consequences *(seriously you don't what to copy paste them specilly in the labs, just don't, nither from here nor from your friends)* and I am in no way liable for any incidents caused by the misuse or blind use of the provided sources.
By continuing to use these source files and any other attached files you take responsibility upon yourself about any damaged that may be renderd to your cource performance. 

Good luck, and happy coding!
Feel free to modify it as needed!
